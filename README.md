## A⛵ me

Hi! I'm Aaryan. I have lots of python automated tasks which couldve been solved within minutes but i love automation. I love using programming as tools in my daily life. I dont have much experience as of yet. I'm still hard at work trying to be good at programming. I dont use social medias as of yet.

## Collaborate?😍

I'd love to collaborate with you on almost any idea. It kinda fells like im selling a service 😂. But no, I genuinely enjoy programming and learning. Ive been self studying for about 4 years on my own.

## Current⚡

I'm currently learning Algorithms and boy o' boy am i excited to come up with O(n^2) and get hit with a O(1)😂

## Contact☎️

I have a discord you can see me there 😁 : @Aaryan22#2876
Also, if you're wondering, YES, I do have an [official geek certificate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab).

## 🥅Goals for 2023

- Update your projects to 2023
- Work more on low level programming
- Find out how to center a div😡
- Get an amazing internship and learn everything you can

# 👋 Hey, I'm Aaryan Dhakal

I'm a backend-focused CS student who loves building automation tools, infrastructure setups, and internal systems that make life easier. I use programming as part of my daily workflow—whether it's orchestrating my homelab, solving annoying repetitive tasks, or experimenting with distributed systems.

I’m currently pursuing my CS degree (YSU → CCBC → Towson University) and working toward a Summer 2026 internship. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🚀 What I Do

- Build backend systems using **Go, Python, and TypeScript**
- Automate everything I possibly can (even tasks that take 2 minutes… because why not?)
- Work heavily with **Docker/Podman, Kubernetes, Linux, and Traefik**
- Design and maintain my own **homelab with VLANs, reverse proxying, monitoring, and global SSH access**

I enjoy solving real problems with code—not just writing programs.

## 🤝 Collaboration

I love collaborating on ideas that involve:

- Backend engineering  
- Infrastructure / DevOps  
- Automation tools  
- Homelab / self-hosting projects  
- APIs, microservices, CLIs  

If you have something cool, experimental, or chaotic, I’m in.
